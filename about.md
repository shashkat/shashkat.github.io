<p align="center">Hello dear reader! I am glad you are here! Below is extremely boring stuff, please dont read.</p>

<p align="justify">I am Shashank Katiyar, a Masters student in the department of Computational Biology at Carnegie Mellon University. I am extremely fond of the interesting ways in which one can apply technology (be it algorithms, software, Machine Learning, Engineering or anything else) into biology. I completed my undergrad from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2023 in the department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, where, apart from doing all the things which happen in a typical boys hostel, I explored various subdomains of Biological Sciences, and ended up falling in love with Computational Biology.</p>

<p align="justify">I am also quite fond of books, an interest I acquired during COVID, and still continue. I also learned to play very noobish guitar during COVID and that triggered a love for music in me. Currently I am learning how to play flute, and I love Imagine Dragons' songs (esp. Birds). Also, I play pool during my free time at CMU.</p>

<p align="justify">Also, apart from the many Computational Biology projects, I am currently working on developing a bot to play slither.io by itself. I really appreciate the beauty and simplicity of slither, and thus wanted to do this project. I know making a hack is not the best way to show your appreciation for a game, but for me its good enough.</p>

<p align="justify">I will add more details here later. Till then, see you!</p>
