Hello reader, welcome to my website. I am glad you are here!

I am Shashank Katiyar, a Computational Biologist at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. Previous to this, I did my Masters in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University. I am extremely fond of the interesting ways in which one can apply technology (be it algorithms, software, Machine Learning, Engineering or anything else) into biology. I completed my undergrad from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2023 in the department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, where I explored various subdomains of Biological Sciences, and ended up falling in love with Computational Biology.

I am also quite fond of books, an interest I acquired during COVID, and still continue, and play some flute in my free time.

Please feel free to reach out to me with any questions about Computational Biology!
