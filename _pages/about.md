Hello dear reader, welcome to my website. I am glad you are here!

I am Shashank Katiyar, a Computational Biologist at Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. Previous to this, I did my Masters in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University. I am extremely fond of the interesting ways in which one can apply technology (be it algorithms, software, Machine Learning, Engineering or anything else) into biology. I completed my undergrad from Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in 2023 in the department of Biological Sciences and Bioengineering, where, apart from doing all the things which happen in a typical boys hostel, I explored various subdomains of Biological Sciences, and ended up falling in love with Computational Biology.

I am also quite fond of books, an interest I acquired during COVID, and still continue. I also learned to play very noobish guitar during COVID and that triggered a love for music in me. Currently I am learning how to play flute, and I love Imagine Dragons' songs (esp. Birds).

Also, apart from the many Computational Biology projects, I am currently working on developing a bot to play slither.io by itself. I really appreciate the beauty and simplicity of slither, and thus wanted to do this project. I know making a hack is not the best way to show your appreciation for a game, but we will think about it once its done.

Please feel free to reach out to me (email preferred) with any questions, ideas or just to strike a random conversation about technology!
