     <p>Hi guys, I am Shashank Katiyar! <br>
     I am currently working on multiple projects involving Cancer Data Analysis. Hopefully, I will be able to make a dent on the catastrophic impact of this deadly disease one day. Do ping me for any discussions related to Bioinformatics, Cancer Genome analysis, or any related field. I am also passionate about Sports and Books, and am a relatively newbie guitarist as of now.</p>
