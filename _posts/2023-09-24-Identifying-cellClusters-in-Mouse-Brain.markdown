![Mouse Brain Clustered](/assets/images/mouse_brain_clustering.png)

In this project, I had to cluster the cells from the mouse brain. Given was the real clustering data from one tissue layer of the mouse and using the gene expression information from the spots in that, I had to predict the cells for another layer. The data from obtained using the Visium technology.
