Okay so let's talk about cancer disease and why it is so difficult to find a cure for it. I will explain how (according to me) an ideal cure for cancer would look like, and along the way I would try to explain what would be the reasons behind each property of the cure. 
NOTE: I may miss some high level details of the things I state here either because of my lack of complete knowledge or intention of skipping over the intricate details. Anyway, I will do my best to ensure whatever I write here, will be correct to the best of my knowledge. 

With that said, lets go.

### A single drug which cures all types of cancers 

Note: The approach is of making a drug check every cell for signs of cancer and fix it. We can't adopt an approach of the type of fixing the ancestors of cancer cells and hoping that the existing cancer cells will die and the new decendants of their ancestors will be fixed. This is because cancer cells generally don't die automatically (as they have hijacked into the normal cell dying mechanism) unlike some of the celltypes of the body, which die automatically after a certain period of time (Eg- blood cells).

Note: An ideal cure of cancer is more necessary than one may think of, because of the unique binary cure property of cancer. It means that one can either eradicate cancer completely or not eradicate it at all as even if one cancer cell remains in the body after the cure, it will again duplicate repeatedly and in some time, cause a more severe cancer (which is what generally happens in remission).

The cure should be a drug (a molecule or maybe even some microorganism like virus), which can reach each and every part of the body. Blood is probably the best means (still has some issues as stated below, so probably need a mix of drug delivery methods) through which it can be made to do so as blood by virtue of its job to provide oxygen to every cell of the body has to go to every part of the body. 
Note: Tumor cells sometimes are out of reach of blood (circulation) as the location of tumor origination goes through fast cell replication in a short amount of time which doesn't allow the blood vessels to develop at the interior of it and the cells inside may adapt to the lack of oxygen. The worst thing about cancer is that it both divides and mutates rapidly, so evolution happens real fast in it, which leads to great adaptation powers. Hence, the attack needs to be one and decisive on it. 

Once the problem of making the drug possibly reach every cell of the body is solved, the next property it should have is the ability to enter the cell. This is because even though some cancer cells are detectable from the outside (Eg- Neuroblastoma), a majority of them are not. Once this (big) problem is solved, another thing that needs to be done is ensuring that the drug doesn't go inside the same cell multiple times. Hence, it needs to be ensured that once the drug enters the cell, it also marks it as "reached". This can possibly be done by embedding a "signal" protein in the cell's membrane once the drug enters it, and the signal protein can be detected by the other drug molecules wandering outside.

Now, once the drug has entered the cell, it needs to also enter the nucleus where it will have to scan the whole DNA (It needs to have the ability to bypass the hidden regions of the DNA (by maybe temporally unfolding it as it scans through) in order to scan the whole genome. Also, once it has finished scanning one chromosome, it needs to begin scanning the next one and keep on doing this repeatedly till the probability of it having not searched through any chromosome is negligible, when its lifecycle will end and it will automatically die or degrade). Using the information it would have of a correct (in regard to tumor suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes) DNA, it will find locations of difference. It will also have the ability to fix these errors as it finds them. This much is not enough, as sometimes just the feature of the tumor suppressor genes' DNA being hidden can lead to cancer (like in https://doi.org/10.1038/nature09307, where a virus causes a tumor suppressor gene, p53, to be hidden in the DNA, leading to cancer) and hence, it also needs to check that there is not any heterochromatin (compressed DNA structure) formation specifically at the sites of the tumor suppressor genes.

Once such an ideal drug is made, there are two ways of making it reach every cell. One is to make a lot (and I mean a lot!) of it so that each of those individual molecules can reach each and every cell of the body and fix them. Another is to make the drug have an ability of exiting the cell after spending some time inside it (to ensure that all chromosomes would have been fixed by it by now). Once it exits the cell, it looks for other cells which haven't been marked so far to go inside them and fix them. This way, the "fixing" can be done by much less drug molecules. However, I think making a lot of a given drug is the least of the concerns when we have already much bigger challenges to deal with before that.

Note: One simplification for the drug could be to just kill the defective cells instead of actually fixing the screwed gene. Much of everything else described would still hold true in that case.


Random Thought: Another intersting cancer specialty is that it is both, fast dividing and not fast dying. I dont think any other cells in the body have this combination of properties (Blood cells are both fast diving and fast dying, gut lining is also both. Basically anything that is fast dividing but not fast dying is a general problem as it will cause immense consumption of resources and i dont think much use). If we can find a drug which targets cells with both these properties only, then it can be a good drug.
